This is an example post to demonstrate how news items and blog posts work in your Quarto website. You can delete this file once you've created your own posts.

## How to Create a New Post

1. **Create a new file** in the `posts/` folder
2. **Name it** using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.qmd`
3. **Copy the YAML header** from this file and update the fields
4. **Write your content** using Markdown

## Markdown Formatting Examples

Here are some common formatting options:

### Text Formatting

- **Bold text** using `**text**`
- *Italic text* using `*text*`
- [Links](https://quarto.org) using `[text](url)`

### Images

To add an image, place it in your `images/` folder and reference it:

```markdown
![Description](images/your-image.jpg)
```

### Code

For inline code use backticks: `like this`

For code blocks:

```python
# Example Python code
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

### Lists

Bullet points:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Numbered lists:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Example Announcements

Here are some types of posts you might create:

- **New Publication**: "Our paper on [topic] was published in [Journal]"
- **Grant Award**: "We received funding from [Agency] for [Project]"
- **New Lab Member**: "Welcome [Name] who joins us as a [Position]"
- **Conference Presentation**: "[Name] presented at [Conference]"
- **Graduation**: "Congratulations to [Name] on defending their thesis!"
